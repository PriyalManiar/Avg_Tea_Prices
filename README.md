# Avg_Tea_Prices
Web scrapping data from the Tea Board of India website for years 2008 to 2023 from the table titled "WEEKLY AVERAGE PRICES OF TOTAL TEA SOLD AT INDIAN AUCTION"

Tea Board Website : https://www.teaboard.gov.in/WEEKLYPRICES/2008

Install the dependencies for running the code using the requirements.txt

The script will save the scraped data from the Tea Board of India website and save it in a CSV fill named 'tea_avg_price.csv'

The output CSV file will be created in the same directory as the script

Additional Notes:
The script checks if the table is available for the particular year, if not it informs the user of the same.
